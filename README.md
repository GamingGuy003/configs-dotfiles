# Configs / Dotfiles

This repository contains some of my personal dotfiles for various usecases and distros. I'll try to keep this as organized as I can although I can't guarantee it lol

## Nixos

The nixos folder contains configs for various setups also including homemanager and theming. I might add more as I progress.

Used tools are:
- hyprland-git
